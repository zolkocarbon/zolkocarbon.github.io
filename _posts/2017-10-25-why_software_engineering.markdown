# Why Software Engineering
This is my first programming blog post and the topic will be why I decided to pursue Software Engineering. 

How I found myself here can be best explained by my past. I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering and my first job involved working with CNC machines. I loved the job and my favorite part was the programming. However, the part I loved the most about this job was progressively being phased out by software solutions to program machines commonly known as computer aided manufacturing (CAM). Manual programming of CNC machines is the gateway to the most efficient code in many applicatons. No redundant moves  are created such as machine moves to a reference point during each pass. While this optimization is great for jobs that run millions of parts it does take a lot of time to manually program these moves. The company I worked for started phasing this programming methedology out due to the progressive shift towards short running jobs in the CNC machines. For a multitude of reasons including this one I decided to leave the company.

A search on Indeed for new engineering opportunites made me realize that most of the search results for "engineering" are software related. This should come as no suprise. Human history has phases of time labeled with terms such as Agricultural and Industrial Revolution. I believe future generations will label this phase of our history with the phrase Computer Revolution. I didn't consider the significance of this until I read Zero to One. It talks about this phase of history in similar terms. This made me think about how much opportunity and demand exists in this filed during this time. The saturation of search results I found on Indeed that were software based coupled with a deeper understanding of the significance of this phase of history made me want to consider programming as a career choice.

My biggest fear was the unknown feelings of sitting behind a monitor for eight plus hours. While we can contemplate on how we might feel the best way to know is to acutally do it. This is pretty easy to do with the number of online courses available today. So I picked FreeCodeCamp and tired it out. With the involved assignments I found myself deeply engaged in the coding problem and really tuned in. When I took breaks I found myself thinking about possible solutions as I stood in line at CVS or layed in my bed trying to go to sleep. 

For anyone considering programming I think they should at least try it to see how they feel about it. You won't know until you try.
